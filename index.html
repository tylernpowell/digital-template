<h2>Alpaca-Alpaca</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Click the alpaca in the center and get more alpacas!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to have a simple and soothing time of clicking an alpaca to get more alpacas.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game is a casual clicker game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The game is very simple, the player must click the alpaca in the center of the screen to increase the amount of alpacas they currently have.  The number of alpacas the player has affects what is displayed on the screen (ie. the text at the top of the screen).  Sounds are also played whenever the player reaches a milestone.  The more the player clicks the alpacas the more alpacas the player recieves in one click.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This game has one mechanic and that is clicking a button (The cool looking alpaca in the center of the window).
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
You get to click an alpaca to obtain more alpacas.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
In the middle of nowhere.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
This game has no story other than the great warm feeling you'll get after obtaining over 1 million alpacas only to question what you're doing with your life.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone is meant to play this game, it's to consume time in a soothing way of just clicking the mouse.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
As long as the player wishes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Click faster to obtain more alpacas.
</li>
